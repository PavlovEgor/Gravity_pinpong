# Gravity Pinpong

Gravity Pinpong is a simple program that simulates the trajectory of a particle in a gravitational field. The particle can bounce off surfaces according to the law of reflection, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

## Features

- Simulates particle movement under gravity.
- Implements surface bounce physics with angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.
- Visual representation of the particle trajectory.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavlovEgor/Gravity_pinpong.git
cd Gravity_pinpong
```

## Usage
```bash
cd application/build
cmake ../
make
./pinpong_in_plane_2D
```
After that, files with various data on particle trajectories will appear in the application/data folder.
